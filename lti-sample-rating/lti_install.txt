Installation Guide
------------------

Follow these steps when using the application with a MySQL or SQLite database:

1.  Unzip the php-rating distribution file and copy the src.zip file onto your web server and extract its contents.
2.  Edit the config.php file to enter the database connection details.
3.  Add some restriction to prevent unauthorised access to the admin directory; for example, using Apache an .htaccess file.
4.  Open the admin/index.php page in a web browser and configure a tool consumer (enter a key, secret and ensure it is enabled).
5.  Use an LTI Tool Consumer to launch the application as an instructor using the tool consumer credentials entered in step 4 and the launch.php page as the launch URL.  If the launch fails try including a custom parameter named "debug" with a value of "true" in the launch request for a more detailed explanation.
6.  Add one or more items for the resource link.
7.  Launch the application as a student from the same link in the tool consumer to rate one or more of the items.

For other types of database connection, create the database tables manually (see the definitions in the db.php file); for non-PDO connections check the LTI_Tool_Provider site (http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/lti_tool_provider/) for a suitable data connector.
